## Introduction

In this chapter you will learn how to

* Start a project in R Studio
* Load a dataset in R Studio
* Subset and summarize data with the dplyr package (part of the tidyverse)

To meet this chapter's learning objectives, please complete the respective exercise sheet. The instructions below will guide you through the process of solving the exercise sheet.


## Start a project and import data

### Step 1

Briefly check out the [exercise sheet](C2_exercise.html){target="blank"} for chapter 2 to get an impression of what you need to learn/know to solve it.

### Step 2

Watch the following YouTube Video: 
[Import Packages and Load Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8B9YU_M5FM&list=PLtL57Fdbwb_Chn-dNR0qBjH3esKS2MXY3&index=3){target="blank"}

### Step 3

Solve Task 1-4 of the exercise sheet.

### Step 4

Watch the following video that introduces you to the DPLYR package:

### Step 5

Solve tasks 6 of the exercise sheet.

## Isolating data

### Step 6

Read the following recipe of the posit cloud:
[The select() command](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes/transform/TransformA){target="blank"}

Solve task 7 of the exercise sheet.

### Step 7

Read the following recipe of the posit cloud:
[The filter() command](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes/transform/TransformL){target="blank"}

Solve task 8-9 of the exercise sheet.

### Step 8

Read the following blog post about the pipe operator:
[The %>% pipe operator](https://www.statology.org/pipe-in-r/){target="blank"}

Solve task 10 of the exercise sheet.

## Deriving Information

### Step 9

Read the following recipe of the posit cloud:
[The summarize() command](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes/transform/TransformH){target="blank"}

Solve Tasks 11 of the exercise sheet.

### Step 10

Read the following recipe of the posit cloud:
[The group_by() command](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes/transform/TransformI){target="blank"}

Solve Tasks 12 of the exercise sheet.

### Step 11

Compare your solutions to the [sample solution](C2_solution.html){target="blank"} for exercise sheet 2.
