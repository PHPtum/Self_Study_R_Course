## Introduction

In this chapter you will learn how to

* Start a project in R Studio
* Load a dataset in R Studio
* Subset and summarize data with the dplyr package (part of the tidyverse)

To meet this chapter's learning objectives, please complete the respective exercise sheet. The instructions below will guide you through the process of solving the exercise sheet.


## Start a project and import data

### Step 1

Briefly check out the [exercise sheet](C2_exercise.html){target="blank"} for chapter 2 to get an impression of what you need to learn/know to solve it.

### Step 2

Watch the following YouTube Video: 
[Import Packages and Load Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8B9YU_M5FM&list=PLtL57Fdbwb_Chn-dNR0qBjH3esKS2MXY3&index=3){target="blank"}

### Step 3

Solve Task 1-4 of the exercise sheet.

### Step 4

Do the “Working with Tibbles” tutorial offered in the posit Cloud:
[Working with Tibbles](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/2.1){target="blank"}

**Comment:** The concept of a tibble is not important for you, but we recommend to do this tutorial anyway since it introduces the dataset you will work with in the subsequent tutorials.

### Step 5

Solve tasks 6 of the exercise sheet.

## Isolating data

### Step 6

Do the “Isolating data with dplyr” tutorial offered in the posit Cloud: 
[Isolating data with dplyr](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/2.2){target="blank"}

Solve tasks 7-10 of the exercise sheet.

## Deriving Information

### Step 7 

Do the first four subchapters of the “Deriving Information with dplyr” tutorial offered in the posit Cloud:
[Deriving Information with dplyr](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/2.3){target="blank"}

Solve Tasks 11-12 of the exercise sheet.

### Step 8

Compare your solutions to the [sample solution](C2_solution.html){target="blank"} for exercise sheet 2.
