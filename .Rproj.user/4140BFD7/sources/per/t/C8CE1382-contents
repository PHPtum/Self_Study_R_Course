### Introduction

In this chapter you will learn how to 

* Build your own customized functions 
* Use Loops 
* Apply the bootstrap method 

To meet this chapter's learning objectives, please complete the respective exercise sheet. The instructions below will guide you through the process of solving the exercise sheet.

## Getting ready

### Step 1

Briefly check out the [exercise sheet](C6_exercise.html){target="blank"} for chapter 6 to get an impression of what you need to learn/know to solve it.

## Functions

### Step 3

Do the following posit Cloud tutorials: 

* [Function Basics](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/6.1){target="blank"}
