No prior knowledge regarding R or other programming languages are required before starting with the Self-Study R Course (SSRC).\r\nThis course is not about teaching you statistics. Hence, results (e.g. of a regression model) or plots are not interpreted in the sample solutions. Obviously, understanding the methods you are applying with R and the interpretation of the respective results should be a crucial part of any data analysis project you are doing. However, to keep this course focused and concise, we decided to ignore statistics and inference aspects to a large extent.\r\nWe assume participants to know some very basic statistics concepts. Which statistics concepts we consider to be very basic is described in the section below. In the chapters where some more advanced statistics methods are applied, we provide links to YouTube videos that explain the respective concepts in an intuitive way.\r\nPrior knowledge\r\nWe assume participants to know the statistics concepts that are presented in the list below.\r\nIf you do not know a concept, just click on it. You will then be redirected to a YouTube video that explains the concept in an intuitive way.\r\nVariable\r\nDistribution\r\nNormal Distribution\r\nMean and Standard Deviation\r\nP-value\r\nCorrelation\r\nLearning outcomes\r\nAfter successfully completing this course, you should be able to\r\nUse R as a calculator and to create vectors, matrices and data frames in R.\r\nLoad a dataset into R and to create subsets and summary statistics for it.\r\nDo basic data manipulations (e.g. rename variables, create new variables) in R.\r\nCreate plots that visualize variation and covariation of different types of variables in R.\r\nEstimate regression models in R and use their results for prediction purposes.\r\nCreate functions that facilitate an easy repetition of various analysis steps in R.\r\nUnderstand the concept of loops and how they can be efficiently used in R.\r\nUse R Markdown to produce reports that summarize the process and results of a data analytics project.\r\nDo a (simple) data analytics project in R completely on your own.\r\nAlthough the SSRC covers a lot of important and relevant aspects, it still scratches at the surface of the R universe. If you work with real world data or if you have to apply more complex statistical methods, you will have to extent your R skill set beyond what is covered in the SSRC. This course is supposed to lay the foundation for solving such problems in R, though. Because of that, the overarching learning objective of this course is that you learn how to learn stuff in R by yourself. This is why the content and teaching parts of the SSRC are collected from diverse, free and immediately available web sources and not customized videos produced by ourselves.\r\nCourse Mechanics\r\nThe SSRC consists of eight chapters that are building up on each other. Each chapter has its own tab on this website. The eight chapters are:\r\nGetting Started\r\nData Analysis Basics\r\nData Manipulation\r\nData Visualization\r\nRegression Models\r\nFunctions and Loops\r\nR Markdown\r\nCase Study\r\nAll chapters (except chapter 8) are structured in the same way. At the core of each chapter is an exercise sheet you are supposed to solve throughout the chapter. An instructions document that is provided in the sub-tab “Instructions” guides you through the process of completing the respective exercise sheet. The instructions document tells you step by step what you have to do to solve the exercise sheet. Usually you will be asked to e.g. watch a YouTube video that teaches you the R skills that are needed to solve the subsequent task(s) of the exercise sheet. In a next step, you will then be asked to solve exactly those tasks.\r\nTo make the process of solving the exercise sheets more convenient, we also provide an R-script template for each exercise sheet.\r\nThere is also a sample solution for each of the exercise sheets and the case study. However, we recommend that you really try hard to solve the exercise sheets on your own before you check out the sample solution.\r\nIf you have problems with working with the SSRC, please check out the FAQs. If the FAQs cannot help you, you can also contact us via e-mail (to php@sg.tum.de, subject: SSRC).\r\nTime management\r\nThe time you will need for a particular chapter and the whole SSRC depends on your programming experience, accuracy, pragmatism etc. This means that it is impossible to make a general statement regarding time requirements. However, to facilitate better planning for you, we at least provide a rough time estimate for each of the chapters below. If you need more time for one or the other chapter, you should not feel bad about it, though.\r\nRough Time Estimates:\r\nChapter 1: 2-3h\r\nChapter 2: 3-4h\r\nChapter 3: 3-4h\r\nChapter 4: 3-4h\r\nChapter 5: 2-3h\r\nChapter 6: 3-4h\r\nChapter 7: 2-3h\r\nChapter 8: 6-8h\r\nIn total the course will require a time effort of about 30 hours.\r\nWhen you invest your time to do the chapters is completely up to you. You can do the whole course in just one week, do one chapter per week, etc. However, since the chapters are building up on each other, you should not let to much time pass between doing the different chapters.\r\nTips on working with R\r\nThe R community is very active and helpful. There are YouTube videos, blog posts, forum discussions (e.g. Stackoverflow) on almost everything.\r\nFurthermore, many ebooks on learning and using R are free and available online: https://bookdown.org/\r\nIf you want to do something in R but you do not now how to do it…\r\nGoogle it!!!\r\nSearch for what you need (e.g. “rename variables”) and add “in R”\r\nThe information is almost certainly available, you just need to find it…;)\r\nEven experienced R users google all the time.\r\nTroubleshooting\r\nAs soon as you start working with R, you will also start getting error messages from R. Do not worry about that, this is absolutely normal. Even the most experienced R users regularly make this experience. The important thing is that you know how to deal with these error messages once they occur. Below you find a list of things that you could do when you get an error message:\r\nCheck whether all brackets are closed and located correctly.\r\nCheck whether you have installed and loaded all required packages.\r\nCheck your code for typos.\r\nCheck whether R´s case sensitivity might be the reason for the error.\r\nCheck for missing or unwarranted quotation marks.\r\nClose and restart R and RStudio\r\nGoogle the error message (or parts of it) and search for potential reasons that trigger this error message.\r\nIn 99.9 % of the cases this will do the job.\r\nIf you cannot find a solution in a reasonable amount of time, you should start looking for a workaround (e.g. a different R package).\r\n[Do not worry if you do not yet understand all of the bullet points above. After doing the first two chapters of the SSRC, this should all make sense to you.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Make sure that the levels of the physical_activity_level and education_level variables are ordered in a reasonable way. (You learned how to do that in chapter 2)\r\nLinear Regression\r\nTask 8\r\nAnalyze the relationship between age and bmi by fitting a linear regression model with the variable bmi as dependent variable and age as independent variable. Call this model lm_mod_restricted. Use the summary() command to check out the results.\r\nTask 9\r\nEstimate a linear regression model with bmi as dependent variable and all other variables in the SSRC data set as independent variables. Call this model lm_mod_full. Use the summary() command to check out the results.\r\nFitted Values and Residuals\r\nTask 10\r\nUse the lm_mod_full model you just fitted in task 9 to add the fitted bmi values to the SSRC dataset. Call this new variable bmi_fitted. Use the str() command to check out whether it worked.\r\nTask 11\r\nCalculate the residuals by substracting the fitted values from the true observed bmi values and add this residuals variable to the SSRC dataset. Check out whether it worked.\r\nTask 12\r\nAnalyze the distribution of the residuals variable you created in task 11 with a histogram and a density plot.\r\nPrediction\r\nTask 13\r\nCreate a data frame with two observations and the four variables: age, gender, education_level and physical_activity_level. The first observation is a female person of age 28 who features both a high level of education and a high level of physical activity. The second observation is a male person of age 59 who features a medium level of education and a low level of physical activity. Call this data frame SSRC_data_new.\r\nTask 14\r\nUse the lm_mod_full model to predict the bmi for the two new observations described in Task 13.\r\nExtracting Coefficients\r\nTask 15\r\nExtract the beta coefficients for the age variable from the lm_mod_full and the lm_mod_restricted model objects. Combine them in data frame that displays the two age coefficients nicely next to each other and where the columns are called full_model and restricted_model. Call this data frame age_coefficients and check it out after creating it.\r\nLogistic Regression\r\nTask 16\r\nCreate an indicator variable that equals one if the bmi of a person is larger or equal to 30 and zero otherwise. Add this variable to the SSRC dataset and call it obesity. (You can use the mutate() command in combination with the ifelse() command to do this in one line of code)\r\nTask 17\r\nFit a logistic regression model with the obesity variable as dependent variable and age, gender, education_level and physical_activity_level as independent variables. Call this model logit_mod. Use the summary() command to check out the results.\r\nTask 18\r\nPredict the probability that the two new observations described in Task 13 are obese. You can reuse the SSRC_data_new dataframe. You can also use the type option of the predict() command to get the predicted probabilities directly. Just set type equal to “response”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n\r\nContents\r\nAbout this course\r\nTarget Audience\r\nBackground\r\nFeedback\r\nContact\r\n\r\nAbout this course\r\nWelcome to our Self-Study R Course (SSRC)!\r\nThe purpose of the SSRC is to teach participants basic R programming skills from scratch.\r\nThe SSRC is comprised of 8 well structured chapters that build upon each other.\r\nCompleting all chapters requires a time investment of about 30 hours. Since the SSRC is a pure self-study course, participants are free to decide when to make this time investment.\r\nParticipants who complete the whole course will be rewarded with a solid foundation of R programming skills. Furthermore, they will learn how to navigate through the R and R Studio universe. They will learn how to learn new methods and commands by themselves, which is by far the most important skill for anybody who is working with R or any other programming language.\r\nFor more details about the SSRC please check out the Course Introduction.\r\nTarget Audience\r\nThe SSRC is designed for everybody who wants to acquire basic R programming skills in a structured way and in a reasonable amount of time.\r\nNo prior knowledge in R or any other programming language is required. We assume participants to know some very basic statistics concepts, though. To learn more about these requirements, please check out the “Prior Knowledge” section of the Course Introduction.\r\nBackground\r\nThe SSRC has been developed by the Professorship of Public Health and Prevention at TUM. The goal of our interdisciplinary team is to generate and synthesize scientific evidence to support decision making in health systems and health policy, with the ultimate goal of improving population health.\r\nWe are teaching several modules in our departments Master’s program. In two of these modules, students have to analyze data in R to meet the learning objectives of the respective modules.\r\nWhen we started teaching in the Master’s program in 2020/2021, we learned that the academic background of students and hence also their prior knowledge in statistics and R are very diverse. There was no doubt that we have to bring all students on a certain R skill level before the programming parts of our modules can start. After intense discussions on how to teach the required R skills, we decided to offer a voluntary self-study R course accompanied by a series of Q&A sessions in the beginning of the semester. We decided to go with a self-study course for two reasons. Firstly, a self-study course enables students to learn at their own pace. This lets us account for the heterogeneity of students in our Master’s program. Secondly, a self-study course gives students some discretion on when to do the course. This lets us account for the fact that students in our Master’s program have very diverse schedules. So far, our experiences with the self-study format have been quite good and our students also seem to appreciate the self-study nature of the course.\r\nThe SSRC has been initially developed in the winter term of 2021/22. In the same term it has been offered to students for the very first time. In the summer term 2022 it has been offered for the second time. In the first two terms, the SSRC website did not exist yet. Instead the material was available in the university teaching file system. However, this way of presentation neither was convenient for lecturers nor for students. Hence, we decided to create this website to organize and offer the SSRC from the winter term 2022/2023 on.\r\nThe SSRC itself benefits tremendously from the R community. Actually, the course would not work at all without the content provided by the community members. In return, we decided to make the SSRC publicly available and (of course) also free of charge.\r\nIf you like the SSRC and the idea behind it, you can help us to raise the awareness of it by twittering something positive a about the SSRC (#SSRC) and/or by spreading the word among your peers and people who might be interested in the SSRC.\r\nFeedback\r\nIn the past, the SSRC heavily benefited from the feedback of the students doing the course. Thank you very much to all of you!\r\nBut for sure the SSRC is not perfect yet and there is still a lot of room for improvements. Hence, we are very happy about any constructive feedback. Just send an e-mail with the subject “SSRC” to php@sg.tum.de.\r\nContact\r\nProfessorship of Public Health and Prevention\r\nDepartment for Sport and Health Sciences\r\nTechnical University of Munich\r\nHomepage: Professorship of Public Health and Prevention\r\nE-Mail: php@sg.tum.de\r\nTwitter: TUMPublicHealth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
